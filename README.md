# You found this! 🤯

In here you'll find tiny scripts I created to automate some repetitive tasks.

The code snippets here are messy, half-formed and unpolished.

But they might actually be useful to others. 


### Backup Encrypter
Give it a directory and it will generate an encrypted tarball for your. It has a snazzy UI reminiscent of the 1980s. And uses shasum, tar ,and openssl that ships with MacOS

### HDD Synchronizer
Nothing but a glofied terminal menu that executes rsyncs across my external HDDS

### Sample Code
Yup. My personal cheat sheet of Python syntax. I was born a Java developer, so I still refer to these training wheels once in a while. 

### School Finder
Give it a primary and secondary school postcodes. It will give you a list of the primary/secondary schools closest to each other. Why? To try find the sweet spot between schools and not having to move in the future. Needs tweaking.

### Sha1 Directory Checker
What the name says. I run these against my external backups regularly to find corrupted files

### Wifi Tester
A glorified ping that logs round trips and errors. Handy to identify connectivity issues and have something to show.
